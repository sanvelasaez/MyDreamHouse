# MyDreamHouse

<i>A place where you can find the house of your dreams</i>

This web is my final degree project, so all the information that appears is an example.

The project consists of imitating a website for the sale of houses, such as Idealista, to demonstrate my knowledge about symfony.

# About the project

This project is a web written with the framework Symfony 5.

The languages and other resources that have been used are:
  <ul>
  <li>Symfony 5</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Twig</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>JQuery (a bit)</li>
  <li>SQLite</li>
  </ul>

SQLite has been used for the database for convenience, because this project is not hosted on any server. And all the data is an example that has been collected from the Idealista website
