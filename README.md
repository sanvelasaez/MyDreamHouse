# MyDreamHouse

Welcome to MyDreamHouse, a web application that allows you to explore your ideal home. This project represents the culmination of my educational journey, serving as my final degree project. Please note that all the information presented here is for illustrative purposes only.

## Project Overview

MyDreamHouse is a web application developed using Symfony 5, a powerful PHP framework known for its versatility and efficiency in building web applications. This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in Symfony and related web development technologies.

### Technologies Used

The following technologies and resources have been employed in the creation of MyDreamHouse:

- **Symfony 5**: The core framework used to build the web application.
- **PHP**: The server-side scripting language that powers Symfony and handles backend functionality.
- **Twig**: A template engine used to create dynamic and structured web pages.
- **HTML (within Twig)**: HTML is used to structure the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are applied for styling and presentation.
- **JavaScript**: Used to enhance interactivity and user experience.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular front-end framework for responsive design.
- **jQuery**: A JavaScript library used to simplify DOM manipulation and enhance user interface elements (to a limited extent).
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database management system used for storing and retrieving data conveniently for this project.

### Data Source

The data used in this project is purely for demonstration purposes and has been collected from the Idealista website. Please keep in mind that this application does not access or retrieve live data from external sources.

## Getting Started Locally

To experience MyDreamHouse locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Symfony 5**: Ensure you have Symfony 5 installed on your local machine. If you are unsure how to do this, refer to Symfony's official documentation or watch a tutorial for guidance.

2. **Initialize Symfony**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Initialize Symfony by running the appropriate command.

3. **Access the Web Application**: Once Symfony is initialized, open a web browser and go to the URL provided by Symfony. You will find the application's index.php file in the 'public' directory.
